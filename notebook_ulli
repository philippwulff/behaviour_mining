Here i take my notes while working on the project to make it easier to set up the real text we want to submit.

Prep:
we made ourselfs familiar with the rl zoo and some of its models.
For running the real code we mainly use google colad for more claculating power and it is easier to reproduce for other people.


start:
Our first real task is to generate data from a different models in the same enviroment.
We use the different models of the zoo which were trained with different algorithms but on the same enviroment(PPO, a2c, ...).
to start we used the enviroment bipedalwalker to make it not too complex at the beginning.
But at the same time it is complex enough to find interesting behaiviors because the trained models ae not perfect like it is often the case with simpler enviroments.
The script enjoy.py uses the trained models automatically, you just have to specify the model and algorithm you want to use.
To the get the data we want we need to make some changes.
In this file we save the observations as well as the actions and reward after every step the model makes.
After running the models we want we safe the data in a csv file.
to analyse the data we use the python libary pandas.
