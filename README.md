## Currently working on:
- testing (and comparing) pretrained stable-baselines models on an env (Ulli)
- training models with optimal hyperparameters from scratch and comparing them on an env (Philipp)
- using a pybullet env (Philipp)

## Gists

1. Behaviour-mining on BipedalWalker-v2 (https://gist.github.com/philippwulff/0da6a1757e39d251d3dc6fa879538ee7)

Note: all files create during the notebook run (videos, images, tensorboard) become visible when opening in google colab.
