# behaviour_mining

## Currently working on:
- testing (and comparing) pretrained stable-baselines models on an env (Ulli)
- training models with optimal hyperparameters from scratch and comparing them on an env (Philipp)
- using a pybullet env (Philipp)

Note: all files create during the notebook run (videos, images, tensorboard) become visible when opening in google colab.
